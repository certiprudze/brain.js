## Using VocALign Pro with Pro Tools 10
 
Now that you have VocALign Pro ready to go, let's see how to use it with Pro Tools 10. Here are the basic steps:

1. Create a new session or open an existing one in Pro Tools 10.
2. Import or record two audio tracks that you want to align: a guide track and a dub track. The guide track is the one that has the correct timing and pitch, while the dub track is the one that needs to be aligned.
3. Select both tracks and go to Edit > Duplicate.
4. Rename the duplicated tracks as "Guide (VocALign)" and "Dub (VocALign)". These will be the tracks that you will process with VocALign Pro.
5. Select the "Guide (VocALign)" track and go to Insert > Plugin > VST3 > Synchro Arts > VocALign Pro. This will open the VocALign Pro interface.
6. In the VocALign Pro interface, click on the Capture Guide button and play back the guide track. This will capture the energy pattern of the guide track and display it in the upper waveform window.
7. Select the "Dub (VocALign)" track and click on the Capture Dub button in the VocALign Pro interface. Play back the dub track. This will capture the energy pattern of the dub track and display it in the lower waveform window.
8. Click on the Edit button in the VocALign Pro interface. This will allow you to adjust some parameters such as alignment accuracy, pitch correction, time modulation, etc. You can also manually edit the alignment by dragging and dropping segments in either waveform window.
9. When you are happy with the alignment, click on the Align button in the VocALign Pro interface. This will process the dub track and create a new aligned dub track that matches the timing and pitch of the guide track. You can preview the result by clicking on the Play Aligned button.
10. To return the aligned dub track to Pro Tools 10, click on the Spot button in the VocALign Pro interface. This will create a new audio clip on a new track called "Aligned Audio". You can then drag and drop this clip onto any track you want.
